## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Running tasks

To get started with this simplistic application;

```sh

# Optional, you can run it with `npx`
npm i -g nx

# Install dependencies (This will handle workspaces too, yay!)
npm i

# This will start the `store` frontend and all of it's dependencies.
nx serve store

```

## Tools

- react (nextjs)
- redux
  - redux toolkit
  - redux saga
  - immer
- nx
- react-error-boundary
- playwright

## Inter-app compat

### Proposed structure for host / orchestrator applications

- State layer will be an app in itself, that can be consumed by all. (`import { state } from 'state/Module';`)
  - This will always be consumed by the orchestator & services can consume them too, allowing rendering of the app in isolation.
- UI Layer
